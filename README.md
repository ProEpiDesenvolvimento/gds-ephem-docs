# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```bash
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

A Githbu action is set up to automatically build the website when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. However, you can also build the website manually:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
